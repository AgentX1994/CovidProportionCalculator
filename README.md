# Coronavirus Active Proportion Calculator
A simple script using BeautifulSoup4, Requests and Tabulate to calculate the Active Cases / 1 Million population proportion for each state in the US (except Oregon, which doesn't report active cases). Outputs the data as a table sorted from highest to lowest active cases per million.

Gets the data by scraping [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us).
